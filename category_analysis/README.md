# Category Analysis

This is an ugly piece of code that I used to experiment with some analysis on some categorical data.

The data set is 2 rows of 5 random values mapped to a hypothetical defect severity scale.
The scale is ordinal.

Most of the analysis ends up being in the collection of graphs produced.
